I realized that I could add links to a few of the blog posts that I wrote for [SageMotion](https://www.sagemotion.com/). You can find them below:

[How does an IMU Work?](https://www.sagemotion.com/blog/how-does-an-imu-work)

[What is an Open Algorithm](https://www.sagemotion.com/blog/what-is-an-open-algorithm) (This was a joint blog by Peter Shull and I)

[How Does IMU Sensor Fusion Work?](https://www.sagemotion.com/blog/how-does-imu-sensor-fusion-work)

I'll try to add more links as I write more posts.
