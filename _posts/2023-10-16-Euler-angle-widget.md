For the [Euler angle blog post](https://www.sagemotion.com/blog/how-do-euler-angles-work) that was posted recently, I thought that it would be cool to have a way to experience Euler angles more interactively. To this end, I made a little widget with javascript and three.js to animate a cube with Euler angles. It does a pretty good job of explaining the different axes and the difference between body and global rotations. You can find the source code [here on github](https://github.com/RTnhN/Euler-Angle-Widget) and a more full screen version of it [here](https://zachstrout.com/Euler-Angle-Widget/).
